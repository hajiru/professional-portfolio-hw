            <p>Hello! My name is Davyn(pronounced Devin)! I came down to Texas from Iowa looking for a better opportunity which has led me to being currently enrolled in UTA Coding Bootcamp. Playing video games is my hobby and I ended up growing up with a PC. Which helped me decide that I wanted to do something in the tech field. I hope to use these skills I learned in the bootcamp at a tech job that I can enjoy and learn even more from a field that's always growing.</p>
